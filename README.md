## What I Found Interesting: 
The digital features developed during the covid 19 pandemic are useful to many businesses. I am delighted to see such a change in the tech field of lots of industries, that most of them adapted plenty of new technical systems(apps for online orders and websites for open hours display). Though it was the downturn in revenues during the covid situation that intrigued most businesses to have accelerated this process, this move will be long-lasting even after the pandemic, prompting the market to be more digitally connected and operations more efficient. 

## Comment from Carrie Ba (zb631)
The pandemic absolutely moved the society to a new stage with the rapid growht of technology industry. We are seeing many new things and ways of living that are supported by technology and especially software development. We also see how the market is shifting within the period of pandemic. I think this could also relate to the article that I found about how Tik Tok is changing people's life. We, human are all accepting new lifestyle, and the trend of this changing would be accompanied with technology for sure. In addition, I totally agreed that the trend would still growing even after the pandemic.
